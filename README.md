## 🎯 **Core Features**

### 🔐 **File Encryption & Decryption**

* **Caesar Cipher**: Basic character shifting for simple encryption.

* **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: A strong, widely-used symmetric block cipher.

* **RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)**: An asymmetric encryption algorithm, ideal for secure key exchange or small data encryption.

* **Vigenère Cipher**: A polyalphabetic substitution cipher using a keyword.

* **DES (Data Encryption Standard)**: An older symmetric-key algorithm, included for historical and comparative purposes.

### 📈 **Algorithm Performance Analysis**

* Compare the execution time of different encryption/decryption algorithms (Caesar, AES, RSA, Vigenère, DES) on uploaded files.

* Visual representation of performance metrics using charts (powered by Chart.js).

### 🔬 **Entropy Analyzer**

* **Shannon Entropy Calculation**: Measures the average uncertainty, or "randomness," of a byte sequence.

* **Bit-Level Entropy Calculation**: Assesses randomness by treating data as a stream of individual bits.

* **RNG Comparison**: Compare the entropy of samples generated by various Python Random Number Generators (`random`, `numpy.random`, `secrets`).

* **Bit-Level Heatmaps**: Visualize the distribution and patterns of bits within generated data to intuitively understand randomness.

### ✅ **File Hashing Tool**

* **SHA256 Hash Generation**: Compute a secure SHA256 hash for any uploaded file.

* **File Integrity Verification**: Easily compare the hashes of two files to determine if they are identical or have been tampered with.

### 💪 **Password Strength Checker**

* Evaluate the strength of a given password against common security criteria:

    * Minimum length (8 characters).

    * Inclusion of uppercase letters.

    * Inclusion of lowercase letters.

    * Inclusion of numbers.

    * Inclusion of special characters.

* Provides immediate feedback on missing criteria and an overall strength rating.

## 🚀 **Quick Start Guide**

### 📋 **Prerequisites**

* ☕ **Python 3.x**

* 📦 **pip** (Python package installer)

### ⚡ **Installation**

1.  **📥 Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/faseey/CyberGuard-Toolkit.git](https://github.com/faseey/CyberGuard-Toolkit.git)
    cd CyberGuard-Toolkit
    ```

2.  **⚙️ Install Dependencies**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```

    Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install Flask cryptography pycryptodome matplotlib seaborn numpy
    ```

3.  **🔨 Run the Application**
    You can start the Flask development server using either command:

    ```bash
    flask run
    # OR
    python app.py
    ```

    The application will typically be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.

    The necessary `uploads/` and `static/heatmaps/` directories will be created automatically upon application startup to store temporary files and generated images.

## 🎮 **How to Use**

The CyberGuard Toolkit is designed for intuitive use.

1.  **Access the Application**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` after starting the Flask server.

2.  **Navigate Through Tools**: Use the navigation bar at the top to access the various functionalities: Home, Encrypt, Decrypt, Performance, Entropy Analyzer, Hashing Tool, and Password Strength.

3.  **Perform an Operation (Example: File Encryption)**:

    * Click on "Encrypt" in the navigation bar.

    * On the encryption page, click "Choose File" to select the file you wish to secure.

    * From the "Choose Algorithm" dropdown, select your preferred encryption method (e.g., AES, RSA, Caesar).

    * If prompted, enter a `Key` or `Shift` value depending on the chosen algorithm.

    * Click the "Encrypt" button.

    * The application will process the file, and once completed, it will prompt you to download the encrypted version, which will be saved to your browser's default download location.

4.  **Explore Other Features**: Each section of the toolkit is designed for simplicity. Follow the on-screen prompts for performing entropy analysis, calculating file hashes, comparing file integrity, or checking password strength.

## 🎨 **Design Considerations**

The CyberGuard Toolkit features a clean, responsive, and modern user interface, designed for clarity and ease of use. It utilizes custom CSS to provide a consistent and visually appealing experience across different tools.
